# ⚠️ CRITICAL: Environment Variables Required for Deployment

## The build is failing because you haven't set the environment variables in Cloudflare!

Your publishable key needs to be added to **Cloudflare Pages**, not just locally!

## Step-by-Step Fix:

### 1. Go to Cloudflare Pages Dashboard
https://dash.cloudflare.com/ → **Workers & Pages** → Select your DevDash project

### 2. Navigate to Settings
Click **Settings** → **Environment Variables**

### 3. Add These Variables (ONE BY ONE):

#### Variable 1:
- **Name:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- **Value:** Your publishable key from Clerk (starts with `pk_test_` or `pk_live_`)
- **Important:** Check BOTH "Production" AND "Preview" checkboxes

#### Variable 2:
- **Name:** `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`  
- **Value:** Your secret key from Clerk (starts with `sk_test_` or `sk_live_`)
- **Important:** Check BOTH "Production" AND "Preview" checkboxes

### 4. Where to Get Your Clerk Keys

1. Go to https://dashboard.clerk.com/
2. Select your application
3. Click on **API Keys** in the sidebar
4. Copy the keys:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (you can see this one)
   - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` (click "Show" to reveal it)

### 5. Save and Redeploy

After adding both variables:
1. Click **Save** in Cloudflare
2. Go to **Deployments** tab
3. Click on the latest deployment
4. Click **Retry deployment**

## Verification Checklist

Before clicking "Retry deployment", verify:

- [ ] I added `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` 
- [ ] I added `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
- [ ] Both variables are set for **Production** environment
- [ ] Both variables are set for **Preview** environment
- [ ] There are no extra spaces before/after the values
- [ ] The values are correct (copied directly from Clerk dashboard)

## Still Failing?

If the build still fails after adding environment variables:

1. **Check the commit:** Make sure Cloudflare is building the latest commit
   - Go to **Settings** → **Builds & deployments**
   - Check the **Production branch** is set to `main`
   - Trigger a new deployment

2. **Verify the keys are correct:**
   - The publishable key should start with `pk_`
   - The secret key should start with `sk_`
   - No spaces, no quotes, just the key itself

3. **Check the deployment logs:**
   - Look for "Missing publishableKey" - means env vars aren't set
   - Look for "Error occurred prerendering" - this is the symptom

## Why This Is Required

Next.js tries to build pages at build time. Without environment variables set in Cloudflare, the build process can't access your Clerk keys, causing the build to fail.

The code changes we made force the app to use **dynamic rendering** (server-side rendering), but you still need to set the environment variables for the build process to complete.

**Quick tip:** You can test if environment variables are working by checking the deployment logs. If you see your variables being used, you'll see log entries related to Clerk initialization.
