# Testing the Insights Page

## Steps to debug the white screen:

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000

3. Check browser console (F12 or Cmd+Option+I) for errors

4. Try navigating to different pages:
   - Home: /
   - Insights: /insights
   - Repositories: /repositories

## Common issues:

1. **Recharts not rendering**: Make sure window is defined (client-side only)
2. **Data loading**: Check if insightsData is properly imported
3. **CSS not loading**: Check if Tailwind is compiling correctly

## Verification steps:

1. Build passes: ✅ (we confirmed this)
2. TypeScript compiles: ✅ (no type errors)
3. All dependencies installed: ✅ (React 19, Next.js 15.5.0)

If you see a white screen, check the browser console for:
- Hydration errors
- "Cannot read property" errors
- Network errors loading chunks

Let me know what you see in the console!
