## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - New features
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*` - Critical production fixes

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
# Update your local main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Making Changes

1. Make your changes in your feature branch
2. Test your changes thoroughly
3. Ensure code follows the style guide
4. Write or update tests if applicable
5. Update documentation if needed

### Testing

```bash
# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run type checking
npm run type-check

# Build the project
npm run build

# Run the production build locally
npm start
```

---

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use explicit return types for functions
- Avoid `any` type - use `unknown` if type is truly unknown

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use meaningful component and prop names

Example:
```tsx
interface ButtonProps {
  label: string;
  onClick: () => void;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
  disabled?: boolean;
}

export function Button({ 
  label, 
  onClick, 
  variant = 'primary',
  disabled = false 
}: ButtonProps) {
  return (
    <button
      onClick={onClick}
      disabled={disabled}
      className={`btn btn-${variant}`}
    >
      {label}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### File Organization

```
app/
  [feature]/
    page.tsx          # Page component
    layout.tsx        # Layout for the feature
    loading.tsx       # Loading state
    error.tsx         # Error boundary

components/
  [feature]/
    FeatureComponent.tsx
    FeatureComponent.test.tsx
  ui/
    [component].tsx   # Reusable UI components

lib/
  utils.ts           # Utility functions
  hooks.ts           # Custom hooks
  types.ts           # Shared types
```

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow the existing design system
- Keep custom CSS minimal
- Use CSS variables for theme colors
- Ensure dark mode support for all components

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: PascalCase for components (`Button.tsx`), camelCase for utilities (`utils.ts`)
- **Components**: PascalCase (`ProfileCard`)
- **Functions**: camelCase (`fetchUserData`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`API_BASE_URL`)
- **Interfaces/Types**: PascalCase (`UserProfile`)
